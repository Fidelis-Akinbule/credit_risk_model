  Interpretation: Model predictions are highly accurate and well-calibrated.
                  Expected loss calculations are reliable for business decisions.

SHAP-INFORMED SEGMENTATION RULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Top Risk Driver: total_delinquencies (59.27% of model impact)

Segment-Specific Recommendations:
  No Delinquencies:
    - Population: ~0.0% of applicants
    - Suggested cutoff: 484 (relaxed by 50 points)
    - Rationale: Clean payment history indicates lower risk

  Low Delinquencies (1-2):
    - Population: ~15.5% of applicants
    - Suggested cutoff: 534 (standard)

  High Delinquencies (3+):
    - Population: ~5.2% of applicants
    - Suggested cutoff: 634 (tightened by 100 points)
    - Rationale: Require stronger compensating factors

TEST SET ADJUSTMENTS (DISTRIBUTION SHIFT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: Test set shows 60.7% higher default probability

Validation Set:               Mean probability: 0.0670 (6.70%)
Test Set:                     Mean probability: 0.1077 (10.77%)
Shift Factor:                 1.61x

Recommended Adjustments for Test Set:
  1. Score Cutoffs:
     Auto-approve:             564 (vs 534 for validation)
     Manual review:            464 (vs 434 for validation)

  2. Loss Reserves:
     Apply 1.61x multiplier to expected loss estimates
     Adjusted EL per approved: $484.08

  3. Pricing:
     Consider risk-based pricing for test population
     Suggested interest rate:  19.6% (vs 15.0% for validation)

  4. Monitoring:
     - Track actual default rates weekly for first 3 months
     - Recalibrate if actual rates exceed predictions by >10%

BUSINESS PARAMETERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loss Given Default (LGD):     60% (Industry standard: 50-70%)
Exposure at Default (EAD):    $10,000
Processing Cost:              $50 per application
Interest Rate:                15% annual
Loan Term:                    3 years
Revenue per Good Loan:        $4,500.00

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Score Calculation:
   - Use calibrated XGBoost model probabilities
   - Convert to 300-900 score scale using PDO methodology
   - Scorecard formula available in deliverables/scorecards/

2. Manual Review Process:
   - Focus on applicants in 434-533 score range
   - Review 2,803 applicants (~9.4% of volume)
   - Assume 50% approval rate for capacity planning
   - Consider SHAP-based segmentation for prioritization

3. Monitoring & Governance:
   - Track approval rates, default rates, and profit metrics monthly
   - Recalibrate model annually or when performance degrades >5%
   - Maintain model documentation for regulatory compliance
   - Implement champion/challenger testing for model updates

4. Regulatory Considerations:
   - Ensure adverse action notices for declined applicants
   - Document decision logic for fair lending compliance
   - Monitor for disparate impact across protected classes
   - Maintain model risk management framework
